# Sean's Blog

Built using Next.JS and Github Pages.

Just clone this repo, create a new github project named $your_username.github.io, follow SETUP instructions and push the modified repo up (on each push the site is getting rebuild and published).

## Setup

- Blog name (etc) in ./components/layout.js
- Posts (markdown) live in ./posts/
- Front page in ./pages/index.js
- Profile pic in ./public/images/profile.webp
- Search for "https://github.com/SeanPedersen/seanpedersen.github.io" and change it to your repo so the Edit on GitHub link works for your blog
