A tiny device that is only a few centimeters long and even shorter height. With a small scroll wheel on the top and a screen on the front. This device lets you scroll through a book, displaying only one word at a time. After a while you can cease to manually scroll and the device will keep scrolling for you (in the same speed you habe). Until you hit the pause/play button and keep reading on.
