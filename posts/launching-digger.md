[Digger.lol](https://digger.lol/) is a visual search & exploration engine, allowing users to browse efficiently and intuitively giant pools of data.

The goal is to create beautiful and useful maps of interesting data, empowering the user to explore more intuitively guided by semantic similarity. No user data needs to be tracked for this to work, the data speaks for itself.

This roughly works by translating semantic (visual or textual) similarity into spatial proximity. Diggers major features are: semantic mapping, text search and image search. The text and image search works bidirectionally, allowing to search for images (e.g. product images) using text and for text (e.g. books) using images.

There is a [desktop version](https://digger.lol/?desktop=true) and a [mobile version](https://grid.digger.lol/). The desktop version provides a global overview. The mobile version is more limited in the global expressivenes but visually not as overwhelming.
