[Digger.lol](https://digger.lol/) is a visual discovery & search engine, allowing users to explore efficiently and intuitively various products.

The goal is to create beautiful and useful maps of interesting data, empowering the user to explore more intuitively and thus save time. No user data needs to be tracked for this to work, the data speaks for itself.

This roughly works by translating semantic (visual or textual) similarity into spatial proximity. The major features digger.lol provides are: semantic map, text search and image search. The text and image search work bidirectional, allowing to search for images (product images) using text and for text (e.g. books) using images.

There is a [desktop version](https://digger.lol/?desktop=true) and a [mobile version](https://grid.digger.lol/). The desktop version provides a global overview. The mobile version is more limited in the global expressivenes but visually not as overwhelming.
