# (Sub)Conscious (Re)Programming

Have you ever found yourself in similar uncomfortable situations, only to later wonder: "Why did this happen again to me?" That moment of questioning is the first step toward "(sub)conscious (re)programming". The process of identifying subconscious patterns that no longer serve us and consciously changing them.

## The Problem of Subconscious Programming

Our behavior is often shaped by coping patterns that developed in response to past traumatic experiences, particularly during childhood. These patterns can embed themselves so deeply in our subconsciousness that we fail to recognize them consciously. They manifest as automatic behaviors and habits that limit or harm us - operating entirely outside our awareness.

These patterns often reveal themselves when we find ourselves repeatedly in similar negative experiences with different people. This repetition is an important hint: if you are the constant in these recurring scenarios, it may indicate that a subconscious pattern in your own mind is at work, that is attracting similar situations based on past unresolved trauma.

## The Importance of Self-Reflection

Healing begins with intentional self-reflection. This process involves:

- Identifying recurring negative patterns in our lives
- Tracing these patterns to their origins in past (traumatic) experiences
- Understanding how these once protective mechanisms now limit us
- Providing room for once surpressed emotions
- Developing alternative responses aligned with our current values

Only through honest introspection can we rewire our subconscious programming with healthier habits, ultimately increasing our self-agency.

## Healing the Root Trauma

If we experience something traumatizing and an emotion wasn't allowed to be felt all the way through, we will unconsciously recreate the circumstances that caused it so that the emotion can move.

This pattern serves a purpose - our psyche is attempting to resolve what remains incomplete.

What appears as self-sabotage is often the mind's attempt to heal by bringing the original wound to consciousness.

Once the emotion can move all the way through you, the circumstances stop getting recreated.

Some reasons emotions aren’t felt all the way through:

- It was sustained over a long period of time (ie fear for 2 years)
- We were shut down or shamed for having the emotion
- It was too overwhelming for us

## The Power of Self-Agency

Recognizing that we have control over our lives - despite subconscious influences - enhances our self-agency. When we embrace our autonomy, we feel empowered to experience more, act more decisively and live our life how we choose to.

While changing these subconscious patterns takes time and consistent effort, it is the only way for true personal growth and liberation from these limiting behaviors.

## Navigating Daily Challenges

Several practical approaches can help us identify and transform subconscious patterns:

- **Daily Journaling**: Document situations that trigger strong emotional responses, looking for patterns that emerge over time
- **Trusted Feedback**: Cultivate relationships with people who can compassionately point out blind spots in your behavior
- **Mindfulness Practices**: Develop the ability to observe your thoughts and reactions without immediate judgment
- **Positive Anchors**: Identify core values and intentional responses you wish to embody and create visual reminders (notes, symbols, images) in your environment
- **Professional Support**: Consider working with a therapist trained in addressing subconscious patterns and trauma responses

These practices require commitment but provide powerful tools for bringing awareness to previously invisible influences. The positive anchors should be based on patterns uncovered through journaling and trusted feedback, that you want to reprogram. These anchors should be placed visibly where you can regularly revisit them so they slowly sink into your subsconsciousness.

## Conclusion

Overcoming trauma and (re)programming our subconsiousness require continuous reflection, self-awareness and the will to grow. By integrating these habits, we can reprogram ourselves with new positive behaviors - ultimately increasing our self-agency.
