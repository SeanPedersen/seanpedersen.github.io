A short list of free AI chat apps for local LLM execution that work offline and promise privacy first (no user data collection).

**Jan** - <https://github.com/menloresearch/jan>

- Standalone app: easy setup
- Open source
- Not many features

**ChatBox** - <https://github.com/chatboxai/chatbox>

- Features: (not yet tested)

**Msty** - <https://msty.app/>

- Standalone app: easy setup
- Closed Source
- Small bootstrapped company
- Features: RAG over files, split (copy) conversations, web search (unreliable right now)

**Deep Chat** - <https://deepchat.thinkinai.xyz/>

- Standalone app: easy setup
- Open source
- Features: integrated web search (Brave Search, Google)

**LM Studio** - <https://lmstudio.ai/>

- Standalone app: easy setup
- Closed Source
- VC Funded (might clash with privacy focus in the future)
- Features: Clean UI, split (copy) conversations

**Open WebUI** - <https://docs.openwebui.com/>

- Web app: hard setup (Install is complicated, requires sign-up)
- Open source

**LibreChat** - <https://www.librechat.ai/>

- Web app: hard setup (requires Docker)
- Open source

## Conclusion

To me Jan and Msty stand out. Jan being a functional basic open-source chat app, that is easy to install and use. While Msty being also easy to setup but with more advanced features - Msty only lacks open-source. I recommend the Llama and Gemma model family for local basic use. DeepSeek R1 for advanced reasoning and coding capabilities.
