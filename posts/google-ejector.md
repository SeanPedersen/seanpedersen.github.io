## Glossary

**End-to-end encrypted** means your data is en- & decrypted only on your machine, resulting in maximum security with maximum responsibility (password loss equals data loss).

**Self-hostable** means anyone can run the software by themselves and thus maintain control of their data independently of any central authority.

**Decentralized** means the software does not need to communicate over the internet with a central server in order to work, instead it is capable of communicating independently via peer-to-peer based networking (very useful when dealing with limited internet availability or censoring governments).

**Federated** means instances of the software build a so called "fediverse" allowing users to communicate across instances.
