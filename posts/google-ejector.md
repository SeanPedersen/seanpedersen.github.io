## Export All Your Google Data

...using <https://takeout.google.com/> and delete your account.

### Converting Google Docs files to Markdown

1. Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to convert docx to markdown
2. Change dir to your Google Drive export: Takeout/Drive
3. Create a lua script named fix_underline_links.lua with this content:

```lua
function Link(el)
  local content = el.content
  if #content == 1 and content[1].t == "Underline" then
    content = content[1].content
  end
  return pandoc.Link(content, el.target)
end
```

4. Run this bash command to convert:

`$ find . -name "*.docx" -type f -exec sh -c 'pandoc "$0" -o "${0%.docx}.md" --extract-media=./images/ --lua-filter=fix_underline_links.lua' {} \;`

5. Remove all docx files: `$ find . -type f -name "*.docx" -delete`


## Glossary

**End-to-end encrypted** means your data is en- & decrypted only on your machine, resulting in maximum security with maximum responsibility (password loss equals data loss).

**Self-hostable** means anyone can run the software by themselves and thus maintain control of their data independently of any central authority.

**Decentralized** means the software does not need to communicate over the internet with a central server in order to work, instead it is capable of communicating independently via peer-to-peer based networking (very useful when dealing with limited internet availability or censoring governments).

**Federated** means instances of the software build a so called "fediverse" allowing users to communicate across instances.
