You have a product (solution for a problem) and need customers (has problem, needs solution) - how do you find them?

## Pain-Point Marketing

Identify specific pain-points your product solves. Get really specific about it and then turn to your favorite search engine and search in niche online communities like Reddit / Twitter threads, YouTube comments and other forums for fresh online discussions with people in need of your solution and write a useful, relevant reply with a lead to your product - a win-win.

This is the cheapest and most effective online marketing strategy I know of.

## Virality

### Affiliate Marketing

Let influencers / customers directly profit from sharing and recommending your product by offering a share of each sale they generate for you.

### Sharing

Build sharing functionality directly into your product, so that it can naturally spread through happy customers sharing their creations with their social network.

## Content Marketing

### Blog Articles (SEO)

Publishing high-quality blog articles that lay out how problems / pain points of your customers can be solved using your product is a good way to but a long game. Your website has to built up reputation - so search engines learn to trust it.

### Videos

Don't just stop with blog articles! Create short and long videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok to engage different customer segments. Keep it short and simple.

## Cold Leads

Write concise E-Mails / DM's to potential customers that clearly state which problem you can solve for them.

## Paid Ads

Generally a hard game because the incentives are off. You want to only pay for engangement that directly generates sales (like you do with affiliate marketing).

### Influencer

Finding relevant influencers that authentically can promote and ideally regularly use your product is a safe bet to reach new customers.

### Platform

Paying social media platforms to display your ads in social media feeds can work but is a hard game...
