You have a product (solution for a problem) and need customers (has problem, needs solution) - how do you find them?

## Data Driven Validation

The following marketing channels may work wildly differently out for your business - so use analytics / promo codes to track how individual channels perform. Only by getting this valuable feedback, can you learn what works and what does not work for you.

## Pain-Point Marketing

Identify specific pain-points your product solves. Get really specific about it and then turn to your favorite search engine and search in niche online communities like Reddit / Twitter threads, YouTube comments and other forums for fresh online discussions with people in need of your solution and write a useful, relevant reply with a lead to your product - a win-win.

This is the cheapest and most effective online marketing strategy I know of.

## Virality

### Sharing

Building sharing functionality directly into your product is the fundament for organic growth. If done right the product will naturally go viral through happy customers sharing their creations with their social network - creating a viral loop.

### Affiliate (Influencer) Marketing

Let influencers / customers directly profit from sharing and recommending your product by offering a share of each sale they generate for you. Find influencers that have followers matching your ideal customer groups and send out partnership offers.

### Community Building

Cultivate long lasting relationships with your customers by creating community via online groups (Discord, WhatsApp, etc.). Use it to gather feedback, new ideas and to inform your customers about novel developments.

## Content Marketing

### Search Engine Optimization

Publishing high-quality blog articles that lay out how problems / pain points of your customers can be solved using your product is a good way to increase visibility for relevant search engine results but a long game. Your website has to built up reputation (useful content + backlinks from reputable websites) - so search engines learn to trust it. Publish useful content on Substack, Medium, Pinterest and SlideShare with links to your website do drive in organic traffic.

### Videos

Don't just stop with blog articles! Create short and long videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok to engage different customer segments. Keep it short and simple.

## Cold Leads

Write concise E-Mails / DM's to your ideal customer groups that clearly state which problem you can solve for them. Use LinkedIn and search engines to find contact information. Automate the sending of the emails using a service below.

## Paid Ads

Generally a hard game because the incentives are off. You want to only pay for engangement that directly generates sales (like you do with affiliate marketing). Try out Google, Reddit and Facebook ads.

### Platform

Paying social media platforms or search engines to display your ads in their feeds can work but is a hard game, that only works if you earn more than you need to invest in the ads.
