# Urban Living

Living in a metropol (big city) is a paradoxical thing: so many humans packed into a tight place but many feel lonely and disconnected - in contrast with living in a small community where social bonds are much stronger.

Naturalize the city landscape - the whole city should look and feel like a beautiful garden park. Bring back beautiful architecture that integrates art works of local craftmen.

Create communal rooms in apartment building stairwells where neighbors can connect for coffee, chats and swapping items.
