# Decentral Software
We need decentral software to live in peace and freedom. Decentral systems are immune to censorship and harder to manipulate by single actors.

Projects like Bitcoin and IPFS are first steps into a better future.

We need cryptographic user identities to verify it is us and we want to own our data (no more locking up data in foreign servers).

Marko Polo: broadcast your content and collab on projects P2P.

Interplanetary Memory System : use file embeddings to discover content instead of brittle crypto hashes (IPMS is a decentral search engine - Anyone can run a node and contribute content. Embeddings are verified by peers.)

Interplanetary Trust System: Rate and discover services based on your local peers you trust -> learn which services your friends praise or dislike.

Interplanetary Messaging System: A decentral, secure messenger that works.
