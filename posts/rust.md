Rust is a statically and strongly typed systems programming language that enforces memory safety (without a garbage collector) through its ownership and borrowing model.

In safe Rust, the compiler prevents entire classes of bugs common in C, such as use-after-free and most data races. It also forces explicit handling of optional values via Option instead of allowing null references. While this shifts many potential failures from runtime to compile time (in contrast with dynamic languages like Python or unsafe manual memory management in C) - Rust does not eliminate logic errors, panics or higher-level concurrency issues like deadlocks.
