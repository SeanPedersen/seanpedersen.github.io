Digital freedom is achieved by getting rid of as many third-party controlled software as possible. A simple test to check how free you are is to unplug your computer from the internet and see how many of your favorite services still work that should not require internet (media files (images, music, videos, etc.), note taking, photo / video editing etc.).

So to increase your freedom and [remove the digital leeches](https://seanpedersen.github.io/posts/google-ejector) like Google and co, invest into privacy respecting software that works offline and ideally is open-source.

Download your favorite music, images, blog articles and videos using tools like:
