**Why even write a design?** The design process animates thinking through ideas deeply before getting lost in the details building them. It provides the chance for different stakeholders to develop a shared vision.

**What makes a successful design?**
It alone must simply suffice to realize the idea it contains.

**Some things to try**:

- First: start with pen & paper and scribble away, to develop a rough outline
- Write concisely and precisely but not too short
- Use clear & vivid explanations (use pictures, graphs when appropriate)
- Avoid too long continuous text passages

## Top Down Approach

Identify distinct, preferably large, independent modules that solve a coherent problem complex which ideally abstract away highly moving parts (things that may likely change / are unknown). Next outline interactions of the modules to map out the interaction dynamics of the system.

“We propose instead that one begins with a list of difficult design decisions or design decisions which are likely to change. Each module is then designed to hide such a decision from the others.” - <http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/parnas-criteria.html>

Finally describe each module as deeply as necessary but not deeper, so that interfaces (behavior towards others) and their functionalities (inner behavior: e.g. algorithms and data structures) are clearly presented. Minimize the information shared with other modules to reduce static coupling (information hiding). Finally draw a clear line between what is solved, what remains unsolved and what is unknowable.
