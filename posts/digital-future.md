# Digital Future: Personal Assistant

Personal assistant powered by LLM via chat and voice interface
- informs you every day what is happening (daily agenda)
- executes tasks for you (setup a blog for me, order my favorite pizza, etc.)

## Integrations

Instead of having separate apps installed or navigating to specialized websites to order products / food, find events, plan my next travel trip, etc. - we will use one unified chat interface (LLM agent) with integrations for services / data sources that enable your agent to do all these things for you.

## Custom Interfaces

Every app / program can be created / customized with natural language
- create an app for me so I stay motivated to do fitness -> uses personal (emotional) triggers to keep you going
- add function X to my TODO app

## Files

Every file has a semantic embeddings making it discoverable with natural language queries (should be on OS level)

Every media file can be manipulated with natural language
- decompose a song into its segments i.e. replace or remove the vocals, change the bass line, remove this annoying segment etc.
- change the style of an image / video
- create completely new custom videos (including spin-offs of your favorite TV shows)

## Ethics

This unified interface has immense abuse potential and thus it is of importance to build a local privacy first version of this - fuck off privacy invading kraken services.
