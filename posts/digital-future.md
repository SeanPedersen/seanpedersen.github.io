Personal assistant powered by LLM via chat and voice interface

- executes tasks for you (setup a blog for me, order my favorite pizza, etc.)

Every file has a semantic embeddings making it discoverable with natural language queries (should be on OS level)

Every media file can be manipulated with natural language
- decompose a song into its segments i.e. replace or remove the vocals, change the bass line, remove this annoying segment etc.

Every program can be manipulated with natural language
- create an app for me so I stay motivated to do fitness -> uses personal (emotional) triggers to keep you going
- add function X to my TODO app
