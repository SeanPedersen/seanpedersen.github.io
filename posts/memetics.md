The term “memetics” was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene. It proposes that just as genes are units of information that self-replicate and evolve, so too can “memes” as units of cultural information.

Memes as Ideas: Dawkins defined a meme as “an idea, a behavior, or a practice that spreads from person to person within a culture.” Think of it as a cultural unit, like a song, a fashion trend, a belief, or a catchphrase. Today memes mostly spread through social media and thus there is a need to study the flow of memes through them, to understand how they influence our thoughts and values.

## Types of Memes

Memes have properties that influence their transmissibility (virality potential) either positively or negatively.

- **antimeme** (high impact, low virality): taboos, uncomfortable / complex truths
- **boring** (low impact, low virality): random dataset, most ads
- **meme** (low impact, high virality): viral videos, slang, norms
- **supermeme** (high impact, high virality): wars, crisis, drama

## Memes and People

- Creators: Creating original / strongly altered memes.
- Spreaders: Spreading existing memes.
- Consumers: Consuming memes.

## Questions of Interest

- How do memes spread through social networks?
- Who creates new memes vs spread existing memes?
- Which hidden creator networks start to spread similar memes at the same time?
- Surface gaps in scientific publishing indicating hidden or indirect censorship
- How much control do I have over my meme intake (social media scroll of doom)?
- Can we pinpoint the cultural shift to wokeness and back to anti-wokeness? Who is changing their positions based on memes often (easy to manipulate)?
- How does the observer effect influence the meme flow (being aware of current meme flows)?
