# Nanorobots - Precise Drug Delivery

Medical nanorobots are tiny vehicles controlled by external electromagnetic fields, enabling them to move through patients veins. The vision is precise delivery of drugs to localized body parts like tumors to minimize side-effects of treatments like chemotherapy.

## Control Mechanism
External magnetic fields manipulate nanorobots containing magnetic materials. Rotating fields create swimming motions, while gradient fields enable directional steering. Controllers adjust field strength and orientation to guide the robots through blood or tissue. Ultrasound or MRI provides real-time tracking without interfering with magnetic control.

## Current Applications
Targeted drug delivery: Nanorobots carry chemotherapy drugs directly to tumors, reducing side effects from systemic treatment.

Cancer therapy: Spiky designs penetrate tumor cell membranes to improve drug absorption. Studies in mice show tumor size reduction.

Minimally invasive surgery: Microrobots navigate blood vessels to reach treatment sites without incisions.

## 2025 Developments
Neutrobots combine magnetic steering with chemical sensing to find targets after injection. Magnetic microrobots aggregate in aneurysm sacs using acoustic propulsion. Biodegradable designs eliminate the need for removal after treatment. Wireless magnetic communication enables coordination between multiple robots.

## Technical Status
Laboratory testing demonstrates successful navigation in simulated environments and animals like mice. Materials include magnetic nanoparticles embedded in biocompatible polymers or gels. Sizes range from nanometers to millimeters depending on application. MRI-compatible tracking methods prevent image distortion during guidance.

## Remaining Obstacles
Immune system recognition remains a challenge for extended circulation. Manufacturing at scale requires new production methods. Long term biocompatibility needs verification across different body environments. Regulatory approval processes for medical devices this novel are undefined.
