# Microplastics - A silent killer

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles present in food, water, air and dust. Research links higher exposure to inflammation, fertility problems and cardiovascular issues. Complete avoidance is impossible, but intake can be reduced. Mass usage of plastics in the economy is a huge mistake (as most organisms lack metabolism to deal with it) and must be stopped.

## Water Sources

Bottled water contains hundreds of thousands of microplastic particles per liter, far more than tap water. The packaging and processing add contamination. Use glass or stainless steel bottles instead.

Filter tap water with NSF/ANSI certified systems like reverse osmosis or certain pitcher filters. Boiling water before filtering may reduce particles further.

## Food Storage

Never microwave food in plastic containers, even those labeled microwave safe. Heat accelerates microplastic release - avoid placing hot food in plastic or running plastic items through dishwashers.

Replace plastic cutting boards with wood or bamboo. Plastic boards shed significant particles when cut. Choose wooden spoons and metal utensils over plastic ones.

Wash rice, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables before cooking. This removes 20 to 40 percent of surface microplastics.

## Food Choices

Buy fresh foods over ultra-processed items in plastic packaging. Choose loose produce when available. Reduce canned goods and plastic wrapped foods.

Limit seafood consumption, especially shellfish, which accumulates ocean microplastics. Use loose leaf tea or plastic free tea bags. Standard tea bags release billions of particles in hot water.

## Household Habits

Wear natural fibers like cotton, wool, or linen. Synthetic fabrics such as polyester and nylon shed microfibers during wear and washing.

Vacuum regularly with HEPA filters. Dust and wet mop surfaces to remove settled microplastics. This reduces inhalation and ingestion from household dust.

## Kitchen Utensils

Metal spoons scraping plastic containers release microplastic particles through abrasion. Plastic yogurt cups made from polypropylene or polystyrene are especially vulnerable to scratching.

Wooden or bamboo spoons are softer and cause less surface damage than metal. The best option is transferring food to glass, ceramic, or metal bowls before eating. Avoid aggressive scraping with any utensil.

## Priority Actions

Start with high impact changes for maximum reduction. Stop buying bottled water. Never heat food in plastic. Use natural materials for food preparation. These steps target the main exposure pathways: water, food and air.

Minimize single use plastics like takeout containers and straws. This lowers both environmental release and personal exposure.
