[Digger Solo](https://solo.digger.lol/) is a machine learning powered file explorer. The two core features are the intuitive file search and file exploration using semantic data maps.

## File Search

The file search works by combining full text search capabilities with semantic search allowing to search for content of text and images by their meaning (even if the image has no descriptive file name).

A multitude of file types are supported:

- Text: pdf, docx, md, txt, pptx, csv, etc.
- Images: psd, jpg, png, webp, etc.
- Videos: mp4, mov, webm, etc.
- Audio: only file name search enabled (for now)

## Semantic Data Maps

See your files come to life in interactive data maps that reveal hidden connections and patterns across your file collections (text, image, video & audio supported) by translating semantic similarity into spatial proximity.

## Privacy

Your files never leave your computer. All processing happens locally. No usage data is collected. Privacy is a feature not just a promise.
