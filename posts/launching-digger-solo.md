[Digger Solo](https://solo.digger.lol/) is a machine learning powered file explorer. The two core features are the intuitive file search and file exploration using semantic data maps.

## File Search

The file search works by combining full text search capabilities with semantic search allowing to search for content of text and images by their meaning (even if the image has no descriptive file name).

A multitude of file types are supported:

- Text: pdf, docx, md, txt, pptx, csv, etc.
- Images: psd, jpg, png, webp, heic, etc.
- Videos: mp4, mov, webm, etc.
- Audio: only file name search enabled (for now)

## Semantic Maps

Explore hidden connections and patterns in your file collections (text, image, video & audio supported) with semantic maps (which translate semantic similarity into spatial proximity).

## Privacy

Your files never leave your computer. All processing happens locally. No usage data is collected. Privacy is a feature not just a promise.

## Use Cases

- Organize huge photo / e-book / paper / music / sample collections automatically using semantic maps
- Remove (near) duplicate files easily
- Find specific objects in images using semantic search
