## Explain the basic idea

power law: sort by size X=size of biggest correlates with X1/1, X2=X1/2, X3=X1/3 = XN=X1/N

## Occurences

human language, city population, passwords

hinting at an emergent deeper pattern at play for self-organizing natural systems.

linguists propose Zipf's law as a test if a language is made up or of human origin.

## Relativation: it occurs also for randomly generated words

"In conclusion, Zipf's law is not a deep law in natural language as one might first have thought. It is very much related the particular representation one chooses, i.e., rank as the independent variable."

TODO: Demonstrate with some python code.

## Closer examination: or does it?

"It is shown that real texts fill the lexical spectrum much more efficiently and regardless of the word length, suggesting that the meaningfulness of Zipfâ€™s law is high." -> Seems Zipf's law is not so easily explained...?

## Conclusion
