# Digital Design
Digital design is concerned with the creation and optimization of user interfaces and experiences across digital platforms (apps, web sites, etc.). At its foundation, effective digital design balances aesthetic appeal with functional usability, ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently while enjoying the interaction. The design of a product sets the tone and communicates (subconsciously) values to the user.

## Good Design
Feels natural - usable without thinking how. Respects the user: increases user agency; bad design extracts it.

- User controls their data
  - Use common file formats (for export / storage)
- Information Hierarchy (pack UI elements together based on their semantics)
  - Minimizes mouse movement / provide keyboard shortcuts for common inputs
- Iterative complexity (progressive disclosure of options)
- Use rows instead of boxes for items that have numerical values to compare
- Use hover highlight effects only for interactive components (links, buttons)
- Design languages / trends:
  - minimalistic: obsidian (grey), [UsByNight](https://www.usbynight.be/) (bold)
  - bold colorful + playful: posthog
  - neobrutalism: [gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)
  - liquid glass: apple
  - functional: [mcmaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/)
- Emotional Design: playful / rewards
- Cultural Differences: japanese love information dense UI

## Bad Design
In order to produce good design, it is very helpful to just feel bad designs.

Dark UX:
- Locking up user data (in a server / custom storage format)
 - Infinite scroll feeds (no ending - addictive for the user)
- Fake urgency (countdown timers, "only 2 left!")
- Requiring account creation before showing content
- Hiding the unsubscribe button (small text / many clicks)
- Forced app downloads to view mobile websites

Bad UI:
- Pop-ups (visual distractions)
- Deviating significantly from proven historical UI patterns
- Inconsistent navigation patterns between pages
- Overusage of animations (only move UI elements with a clear signal / purpose)
- Loading spinners that never end / indicate no progress
- Auto-playing videos with sound
- Confirmation dialogs for every minor action
- Non-descriptive error messages
- Disabling zoom on mobile
- Missing auto-focus of text input (seach bars etc.)
- Low contrast text (poor accessibility)

## Impact
Digital interfaces are control surfaces: they don’t just enable actions, they shape which actions are likely to occur. Layout, defaults, friction and feedback loops guide attention and influence our behavior - often without the user’s conscious awareness.

Because of this, design is never neutral. Repeated interaction patterns become memetic: they train habits, normalize expectations and propagate values across products and cultures. An infinite feed normalizes consumption without closure; an opaque system teaches dependence; a reversible, inspectable UI teaches agency.

Bad design is therefore not just inconvenient - it is political. It encodes power asymmetries into everyday interactions by extracting our attention, data and autonomy. Good design does the opposite: it makes data control explicit and preserves optionality, to give the user the control they deserve.
