Digital design is concerned with the creation and optimization of user interfaces and experiences across digital platforms (apps, web sites, etc.). At its foundation, effective digital design balances aesthetic appeal with functional usability, ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently while enjoying the interaction. The design of a product sets the tone and communicates (subconsciously) values to the user.

- Iterative complexity
- Use rows instead of boxes for items that have numerical values to compare
- Use hover highlight effects only for interactive components (links, buttons)

## Bad Design

In order to produce good design, it is very helpful to just feel bad designs.

Dark UX:
- Infinite scroll feeds (no ending - addictive for the user)
- Fake urgency (countdown timers, "only 2 left!")
- Requiring account creation before showing content
- Hiding the unsubscribe button (small text / many clicks)
- Forced app downloads to view mobile websites

Bad UI:
- Pop-ups (visual distractions)
- Deviating significantly from proven historical UI patterns
- Inconsistent navigation patterns between pages
- Loading spinners that never end / indicate no progress
- Auto-playing videos with sound
- Confirmation dialogs for every minor action
- Non-descriptive error messages
- Disabling zoom on mobile
- Low contrast text (poor accessibility)
